## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

- I want to continue to focus on Flexbox, and continue to master it.
- Need to work on the JavaScript portion of this project. I want to be able to make this dynamic, in the sense that users can put in any ratings they want, and the result should change.
